Welcome to the **go-hugo** project documentation site.

This site is built using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator and the [Docsy](https://www.docsy.dev/) theme, and is deployed via GitHub Pages. It is intended as an educational and modular reference for building Hugo-based documentation with versioning, GitHub Actions deployment, and multi-language support.

### Goals of this project:

- Provide a minimal, functional Hugo + Docsy site as a reference template.
- Document every setup step clearly for reproducibility.
- Enable CI/CD deployment to GitHub Pages.
- Support future extensions like multi-language, diagrams, and embedded code samples.

Refer to the sidebar for detailed guides and development notes.
